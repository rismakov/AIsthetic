            AIsthetic is a wardrobe optimizer that helps you decide what to wear, 
            helps pack for a trip, and helps find items in your closet that best 
            resemble an inspiration photo.\n\n

            All you have to do is upload images of closet, and the app does the rest
            for you.\n\n

            With this app, you can:\n
            1. View all items in your closet.
            2. Select a random outfit based on weather and occasion.
            3. Surface outfit pieces that most closely resemble those from an
                inspiration image (e.g. Pinterest post).
            4. Generate an itinerary of clothing for your next trip based on trip 
                start date, trip end date, location, and luggage allowances.

            helping with diminishing decision fatigue, with reducing need to
            purchase more clothing, and with optimizing travel planning.

            The algorithm currently has logic in place that determines whether
            two items match together and that ensures the same item isn't
            selected too close together when creating an outfit plan. For the
            trip planner feature, the app scrapes weather data to determine
            which clothing items are appropriate for the chosen days.

        Please tag the following item accordingly by style (basic vs

        if it is simple, solid-colored and able to match to many other items.

        In order to limit manual user oversight and prevent user fatigue, a
        CNN Image Classification model was trained on 15000+ labeled images
        and was used to predict the appropriate category an item should fall
        into. The algorithm then uses this information to determine how to
        style clothing articles together.\n\n
        Keep in mind however, that the model may fail at times to categorize
        properly; in such a case, the user has the option to update the tags
        manually.
